# Introduction

**MSP Notifier** is a messaging framework for Magento 2 allowing users and developers to **easily integrate a wide set
of communication channels** (Telegram, Slack and others) for real-time notification.

## Project philosophy

MSP Notifier Project is an extensible tool projected around the **Domain Driven Development** best practices.
In other word: it is a **set of smaller modules** with well defined responsibilities and features.
